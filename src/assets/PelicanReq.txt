- I have a Discord bot that tracks invites on a on a 30K member server

- When a user types a command, I will make it call a method generateLink(userToConfirm, referee) [you will make this method]

  The method returns a string containing a link e.g. "https://cock.la/1823yad8y12312a (so I can get the bot to send that link)"

- The link will contain a captcha, and is hooked up to an API that checks for the country of the user, and whether it is a VPN or not. Use a web framework library for Java.

- If captcha is passed, the IP is not a proxy, and if the IP is currently not associated with another user, reward the referee with points.

- There will be a table of country's and their "values" (USA - 10 points, European countries - 10 points)

- The user gets "confirmed" and the referee gets the points based off of the value of the user

- The confirmation is saved so that when they leave or cease to use the services, we can penalize them by the correct amount. Additionally, the IP is saved in this confirmation so we can attempt to prevent people who abuse this system.

  Use a responsive HTML template for the front-end so you don't have to design stuff. Back-end needs to be in Java because the Discord API wrapper I use is in Java.
